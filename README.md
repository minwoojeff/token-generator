# Token-Generator

This service is designed to generate a token, defined by a provided e-mail. 

## **NOTE**

Please note that this project is not production ready. This project listens over port :80 (HTTP) and thus runs risks associated with JWT. Please ensure to update the code such that it runs over :443 (HTTPS) for improved security.
